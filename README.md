Authentication Flow

User submits credentials
API returns JWT token
Token stored in localStorage and httpOnly cookie
Middleware validates token on protected routes
Context provides user state throughout app

Development
Code Organization

TypeScript: Strict type checking enabled
Component patterns: Functional components with hooks
Error boundaries: Graceful error handling
Performance: Code splitting and lazy loading

Available Scripts
bashnpm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
Styling Guidelines

Tailwind Classes: Use utility classes for styling
Component Variants: Leverage class-variance-authority for variants
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach
Design System: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography

API Integration
The app follows these patterns for API calls:
typescript// Service-based approach
const authService = {
  async login(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<AuthResponse> {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// Error handling
try {
  const response = await authService.login(credentials)
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error
}
